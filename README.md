- 👋 Hi, I’m @budmilkshake
- 👀 I’m interested in ...hacking any cell and all its features both ios and droid WITHOUT the target device being in hand or even close by. I recentlyhad my world hacked and just about ending my life for having caused my geriatric ass to lose every last damn posession, dollar, and actual roof over my head rendering me homeless and without a soul on earth to help as the person who did all this didnt have to hack anything as he alrerady knew all my passwords and inner most deepest most valuable secrets as to where my money was hidden and what my greatest asset was ... my contacts/customers accumilated and slaved over to earn over a 15 year period all gone and stolen and sold to a competitor never to be heard from again as a thank you message fro the boy i saved from the runoff tunnels of Vegas homeless when he was 16 whom I took in and raised as my own over 8 years and about 2 million$ along with my security and driver guy of 5 years that has now come to mean stealing my life from me and to this day even though having changed passwords and all known ties and links to my shyt closed, still seems to know what im doing and whom im trying to reach in vein and also somehow stopping all incoming calls and texts as well. I was told by a couple loyal clients that my ex driver has approached and sold them product while proclaiming i am going to jail and plan on hacking and destroying all my customers who stopped buying from me and that they have a wealthy backer financing and choreographing the whole show as well as pimping out Ryan the boy i took in who caught in one of my accounts browser history looking up a mind control drug called lybalvi which is something Ryan would just never do and he doesnt evebn remeber my name sometimes when ive been able to contact him. Hes also very careful not to ever leave his location services on and changes his numbers very often.

- Im also interested in destroying whoever the financier of the ir operation is ( i have  pretty good idea whom it is) who is a demented sexual preditor whos been very vocal on the subject of his ability to write a check for 2 million and cash it at his local chase of B of A like a $100 check.

- Then also interested in hidden wiki links to darknets best .onion sites.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...carding and fingerprint, cookies, user agent string cloning, cookies, otp bots, sim cloning, socks 5 and vpn usage with spamming for logs and cc's, exploits of every and all kinds, and finding legit places for non vbv cc and debit dumps w pin after losing over 20k in vendor scams n rips leaving about homeless and desperate for justice and getting my life back i worked 24/7 365 a year for 15 years to achieve, literally only taking a break upon passing out cold when my body would give out..usually smashing my head or face into a table or floor whenever it would happen so that i could finally hang up my spurs and take my retirement in the final reward of peace and tranquility with no worries or drama like i provided for Ryan from day one. Only to be dealt the ultimate betrayal in the end..or so at least im hoping he and co conspiritors just think is the end only to be dealt the same final blow in return they intended for me. Dished out and served cold by Karma herself of course helped along by and with anyone who might see this and take to heart personally what they have done to me in such personal disgrace and malice. Pariah's and blight's on the face of humanity as these slime buckets are and destroy the heathenous mongrol lecherous traitorious, ungrateful, unconscionable souless immoral backstabbing cold blooded kille, scum they are.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything that might bring me back to viable and man of respect, means, intellect, benevolence, kindness, wisdom, and love at the speed of light if possible or next fastest speed.
